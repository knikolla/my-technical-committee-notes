Hi all,

Here’s another edition of “What’s happening on the Technical Committee.”

Meeting

Happenings
==========

Final call for Winstackers (and Windows Support)
------------------------------------------------
Cloudbase Solutions are no longer in a position to maintain support for running OpenStack on Windows and have also ceased operation of their 3rd party CI for the windows support across a number of OpenStack projects.

This is the final call for any maintainers to step forward for maintaining Winstackers if this feature is important to them in OpenStack[0][1]. If there is no response by June 2023, we will discuss the retirement of this project.

Final call for Vitrage maintainers
----------------------------------
This is the final call for maintainers. If anyone is using or interested in this project, this is the right time to step up. If there is no response by the end of April 2023, we will discuss the retirement of this project.[0]

Patrole retirement
------------------
As notified on the mailing list yesterday[0] and by a patch proposed to the governance repo[1], the Patrole project is being retired.
The project is inactive, and there was no interest from prospective maintainers.

Gate status
-----------
Every week we have a look at the overall status of the "gate". In the last meeting the status was reported and not super healthy[0].

* The U-C bump broke Glance's functional test and there is a desire to put Glance's functional tests behind the U-C gate so that future breakages are caught before they happen.
* It was also reported that we were seeing some guest kernel crashes on volume tests. These may be related to nested virtualization.
